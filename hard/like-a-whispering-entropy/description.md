I don't trust those who wrote crypto implementations, so I had to write my own ...
I created everything from scratch so I know it is safe ! No one backdoored my Diffie-Hellman implementation !

Btw, I gave you an output of a connection to my service, but anyway you won't be able to get back the secret message
